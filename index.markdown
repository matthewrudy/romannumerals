# Roman Numerals

## Building Blocks

Any roman numeral is constructed from a combination of these basic building blocks

* I = 1
* V = 5
* X = 10
* L = 50
* C = 100
* D = 500
* M = 1000

## Adding

We can make other numbers by adding these building blocks together.

For example, the numbers up to 3 are exactly

* I = 1
* II = 2
* III = 3

We're just joining together up to 3 of the same building lock.

We can join different building blocks together, with the rule that the biggest block must go first.

So we can make these simple large numbers

* XI = 11
* CI = 101
* MCXI = 1111

For most numbers, though, we need to add use both of these methods, adding together multiple blocks of each

* XXI = 21
* MMI = 2001
* MMXV = 2015

## Subtracting

We can make even more numbers by subtracting numerals from each other.

We can only subtract a numeral of exactly one order of magnitude less. (ie. we can take 10 from 100, or 10 from 50, but not 10 from 1000)

* IV = 4
* IX = 9
* XL = 40
* XC = 90
* CD = 400
* CM = 900

Actually, these are all of the compound numerals that exist.

## Adding VS Subtracting

You will have noticed that a number like 4 can be made in 2 ways;

* IIII - adding
* IV - subtracting

You'll see both of these examples in different places, but it's generally accepted that subtracting is the simplest and most acceptable form.

## Bigger numbers?

You'll notice that the biggest number we can write is MMMCMXCIX = 3999.

As it happens that is in fact the largest number we can write with regular roman numerals.
